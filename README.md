## How to play

A series of pattern (up, down, left, right) will come out. Then, player needs to replicate the pattern generated by the game. From time to time, the pattern keeps getting longer and longer and player needs to memorize it all in order to score the game.
The game is over when the player incorrectly inputted the pattern at some point.
